    <h1>Welcome to Genshin Impact</h1>
    <h2>About Genshin Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Genshin Impact is an open-world action role-playing game developed and
      published by miHoYo. It features a fantasy open-world environment and
      action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching,
      and uses gacha game monetization for players to obtain new characters,
      weapons, and other resources.
    </p>
    <h3>Characters in Genshin Impact</h3>
    <p>
      There are several unique characters in Genshin Impact, each with their own
      special abilities and elements. Players can build a party of up to four
      characters to complete quests and explore the world.
    </p>
    <h3>Weapons in Genshin Impact</h3>
    <p>
      In Genshin Impact, weapons are equipment that assist the player in combat
      to deal more damage1. There are five different types of weapons: swords,
      claymores, bows, polearms, and catalysts12. Each character is only able to
      wield one weapon type
    </p>
    <p>Here is a brief overview of each weapon type:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <span>Swords:</span> These are melee-range weapons that can easily
        inflict knockback on foes. They are lightweight and quick, but do not
        hit as hard as a Claymore
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Claymores:</span> These are melee-range weapons that hit slower
        than Swords and Polearms, but deal much more damage per swing. They are
        considered Blunt Attacks and deal increased damage to Geo objects, such
        as monster shields
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Polearms:</span> These have fast attacks, long forward reach, and
        deal moderate damage per hit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Catalysts:</span> Due to their magical nature, all Normal and
        Charged Attacks performed with a Catalyst are considered elemental
        damage. The element of the damage depends on the wielder natural
        element/vision
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Bows:</span> Bows boast long-ranged attacks, with Charged Attacks
        that are capable of hitting monsters as far as the eye can see with the
        proper aim. A fully-Charged Attack deals elemental damage
      </li>
    </ol>
